class QLearning:
    """
    QLearning reinforcement learning agent.

    Arguments:
      epsilon - (float) The probability of randomly exploring the action space
        rather than exploiting the best action.
      alpha - (float) The weighting to give current rewards in estimating Q. This 
        should range [0,1], where 0 means "don't change the Q estimate based on 
        current reward" 
      gamma - (float) This is the weight given to expected future rewards when 
        estimating Q(s,a). It should be in the range [0,1]. Here 0 means "don't
        incorporate estimates of future rewards into the reestimate of Q(s,a)"

        Trains an agent using Q-Learning on an OpenAI Gymnasium Environment.

        See page 131 of Sutton and Barto's book Reinforcement Learning for
        pseudocode (http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf).
        Initialize your parameters as all zeros. Choose actions with
        an epsilon-greedy approach Note that unlike the pseudocode, we are
        looping over a total number of steps, and not a total number of
        episodes. This allows us to ensure that all of our trials have the same
        number of steps--and thus roughly the same amount of computation time.

        See (https://gymnasium.farama.org/) for examples of how to use the OpenAI
        Gymnasium Environment interface.

        In every step of the fit() function, you should sample
            two random numbers using functions from `src.random`.
            1.  First, use either `src.random.rand()` or `src.random.uniform()`
                to decide whether to explore or exploit.
            2. Then, use `src.random.choice` or `src.random.randint` to decide
                which action to choose. Even when exploiting, you should make a
                call to `src.random` to break (possible) ties.

        Please don't use `np.random` functions; use the ones from `src.random`!
        Please do not use `env.action_space.sample()`!

        Hints:
          - Use env.action_space.n and env.observation_space.n to get the
            number of available actions and states, respectively.
          - Remember to reset your environment at the end of each episode. To
            do this, call env.reset() whenever the value of "terminated or truncated" returned
            from env.step() is True.
          - In addition to resetting the environment, calling env.reset() will
            return the environment's initial state.
          - When choosing to exploit the best action rather than exploring,
            do not use np.argmax: it will deterministically break ties by
            choosing the lowest index of among the tied values. Instead,
            please *randomly choose* one of those tied-for-the-largest values.

        Arguments:
          env - (Env) An OpenAI Gymnasium environment with discrete actions and
            observations. See the OpenAI Gymnasium documentation for example use
            cases (https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/core/).
          steps - (int) The number of actions to perform within the environment
            during training.

        Returns:
          state_action_values - (np.array) The values assigned by the algorithm
            to each state-action pair as a 2D numpy array. The dimensionality
            of the numpy array should be S x A, where S is the number of
            states in the environment and A is the number of possible actions.
          rewards - (np.array) A 1D sequence of averaged rewards of length num_bins.
            Let s = int(np.ceil(steps / num_bins)), then rewards[0] should
            contain the average reward over the first s steps, rewards[1]
            should contain the average reward over the next s steps, etc.
            Please note that: The total number of steps will not always divide evenly by the 
            number of bins. This means the last group of steps may be smaller than the rest of 
            the groups. In this case, we can't divide by s to find the average reward per step 
            because we have less than s steps remaining for the last group.
